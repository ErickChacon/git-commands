## [Setting up Git](https://github.com/ErickChacon/git-commands/blob/master/set-up.md)

To start using Git, it is required to create a user and a ssh-key for
authentication with the remote repository.

## Git Commands

### Clone a repository
Clone command
```
git clone git@github.com:ErickChacon/git-commands.git
```
Check git-commands folder to see all the files included in the repository.

### Work in branches

See what branch you are on:
```
git branch
```

Create a new branch:
```
git checkout -b branchname
```

Switch between branches:
```
git checkout branchname
```

Delete branch locally:
```
git branch -D branchname
```
Delete branch globally:
```
git push origin --delete branchname
```

### Add, modify or remove files

You can create, delete and modified files on the current folder of the
repository.
Track these files:
```
git status
```

Add and rm files to the index:
```
git add filename
git rm filename
```

Update new, removed and modified files with any of these commands:
```
git add -A
git add -all
git add -no-ignore-removal
```

Make a commit to record changes of the repository:
```
git commit -m "useful message"
```

### Pull and push

To send recorded changes to the remote repository:
```
git push origin branchname
```

To receive recorder changes from the remote repository:
```
git pull origin branchname
```

### Merge branch with master repository

Update my branch according to the master:
```
git checkout branchname
git pull origin master
```

Merge my brach into master:
```
git checkout master
git merge brachname
```
 
To see how it was merged:
